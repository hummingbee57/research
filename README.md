## Accuracy of Different Machine Learning Models in Predicting Wildfire Spread in Southern California
### Repo for my research project on using machine learning to predict wildfires in California

This project tests different machine learning models to determine which is most accurate for predicting the spread of wildfires in California.

Libraries used:
* pandas
* geopandas
* matplotlib
* shapely
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow (possibly)
